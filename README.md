# Single-Phase Controlled Rectifier with Inductive Load Simulation

## Overview

This project involves the simulation of a single-phase controlled rectifier with an inductive load using MATLAB Simulink. The purpose of this simulation is to understand and analyze the behavior of the rectifier circuit, including the input and output voltages, as well as the current flowing through thyristor.

The key components of this project include:

- **Single-Phase Controlled Rectifier:** This circuit uses thyristors (SCRs) to control the rectification process. The rectifier converts an AC input voltage into a DC output voltage.

- **Inductive Load:** An inductive load is connected to the rectifier output to simulate real-world scenarios where inductive loads are common, such as in power supply applications.
